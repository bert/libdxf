# Welcome to libdxf

libdxf is a library (written in C) with DXF related functions.

The Drawing eXchange Format (DXF) is a defacto industry standard for the
exchange of drawing files between various Computer Aided Drafting programs,
designed by Autodesk(TM).

Currently this project has a "Work in progress" status.

The code base is still incomplete and is not debugged to an acceptable level.

My aim for the libdxf-0.0.1 release is to publish a R14 compliant library, and
from that point improve as to be compliant with newer editions of DXF.

You are always welcome to help with patches or bug reports :-)

In the mean time one can always fork the latest code from the Github repository and
help with patches or [bug reports](https://launchpad.net/libdxf)

Developer documentation can be found [here](http://ljh4timm.home.xs4all.nl/libdxf/doxygen/index.html) .
