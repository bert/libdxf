/*!
 * \brief DXF definition of an AutoCAD text entity.
 *
 * DXFOUT handles ASCII control characters in text strings by expanding the
 * character into a ^ (caret) followed by the appropriate letter.\n
 * For example, an ASCII Control-G (BEL, decimal code 7) is output as ^G.\n
 * If the text itself contains a caret character, it is expanded to ^ (caret,
 * space).\n
 * DXFIN performs the complementary conversion.
