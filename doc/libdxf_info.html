<b>I write this documentation because I think, in my honest opinion, that the "official" reference is incomplete, often with errors or without descriptions, in particular the old references often change completely style and the new one presents much errors and deficiencies (for example it is since version u19.1.01 in February 2004 that Autodesk Inc. doesn't change the chapter "Revisions to the DXF Reference", and only in the version u15.0.02 this chapter is complete and correct).<br>
I hope this work can help who wants to understand how to read and write a dxf, however this may not be a complete reference, due to the licenses with which the "originals" are distributed.<br>
Their policy is so closed that would not allow a "deep link" to the page of the dxf reference, so I can only tell you where the page can be found:<br>

The author of this documentation is Paolo Caroni (me), but the files <a href="class.html">class.html</a> and <a href="hatch.html">hatch.html</a> was written by Bert Timmerman (the author of libDXF project),<br>
the file <a href="libdxf_main.html">libdxf_main.html</a> was written by me but it is only a translation in html from a txt file (written by Bert) with little changes.<br>
