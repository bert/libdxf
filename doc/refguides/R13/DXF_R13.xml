      <title/>

      <para>This online reference updates chapter 13 of the AutoCAD Release 13
      Developer's Guide (dated earlier than 14 April 1995).</para>

      <para><note>
          <para>The DXF group codes presented in this reference should be used
          instead of the group codes described in the AutoCAD Release 13
          Customization Guide (publication number 00105-010000-5040, dated 13
          September 1994).</para>
        </note>The following labels may be included in group code
      descriptions:</para>

      <para>DXF: Describes how the code applies to DXF files.</para>

      <para>DXF only: Indicates that this code is found only in DXF
      files.</para>

      <para>Application: Describes how the code applies to AutoLISP, ADS, and
      ARX applications.</para>

      <para>Application only: Indicates that this code is found only in
      AutoLISP, ADS, and ARX applications.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Drawing Interchange File Formats.</title>

        <para>AutoCAD can be used as a complete drawing editor.</para>

        <para>However, in some applications, other programs must examine
        AutoCAD drawings or generate drawings to be viewed, modified, or
        plotted with AutoCAD.</para>

        <para>Three types of file formats for importing and exporting drawing
        data are described in this chapter.</para>

        <para>Drawing Interchange Format (DXF) files enable the interchange of
        drawings between AutoCAD and other programs.</para>

        <para>DXF files can be either ASCII or binary formats.</para>

        <para>All implementations of AutoCAD accept the ASCII DXF format
        (however, backwards compatibility is not guaranteed).</para>

        <para>ASCII DXF files can be easily translated to the formats of other
        CAD systems or submitted to other programs for specialized
        analysis.</para>

        <para>Because ASCII DXF files are more common than the binary format,
        this chapter uses the term DXF file when referring to ASCII DXF files
        and the term binary DXF files when referring to the binary
        format.</para>

        <para>Both ASCII and binary DXF files contain a complete description
        of the AutoCAD drawing.</para>

        <para>Because much of the data in an AutoCAD drawing does not have an
        equivalent object type in other programs, the Drawing Interchange
        Binary (DXB) file format is provided, which creates a simpler
        geometric description of the drawing.</para>

        <para><note>
            <para>It is recommended that you not create programs to read .dwg
            files.</para>

            <para>The format of this file can change significantly as new
            features are added to AutoCAD.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>ASCII DXF File Format.</title>

    <para>This section describes the format of ASCII DXF files.</para>

    <para>It contains information that is needed only if you write your own
    programs to process DXF files or work with entity information obtained by
    AutoLISP and ADS applications.</para>

    <section>
      <title>New for AutoCAD Release13.</title>

      <para>The following rules and conventions are new in AutoCAD Release 13
      and apply directly to DXF files:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Handles are always enabled.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All database objects (including symbol tables, symbol table
          entries, and dictionaries) have handles and may have extended data
          (xdata) and persistent reactors.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Group order independence is de-emphasized.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For more information on new DXF concepts, see Advanced DXF
      Issues.</para>

      <para>The new DXF file sections are CLASSES and OBJECTS.</para>

      <para>A new table, BLOCK_RECORD, has been added to the TABLES
      section.</para>

      <para>The new group codes and group code ranges are as follows:</para>

      </table>

      <para>Some of the new group codes represent new data types, such as
      8-bit and 32-bit integer values, while others perpetuate the
      ever-expanding dimension style symbol table.</para>

      <para>Also, specific group codes have been added for various new fields
      and structures associated with entities and objects, such as object
      references and linetype scaling.</para>

      <para>The new group codes are defined in order to give application
      developers a few codes for each data type with the intent of reusing the
      currently available group code ranges as needed.</para>

      <para>Programs parsing DXF files and result buffer chains in ADS and
      AutoLISP that are intended to be tolerant of new AutoCAD versions are
      supposed to ignore group codes they do not recognize.</para>

      <para>It is trivial for ADS, AutoLISP, and ARX programs to do so, as
      well as for ASCII DXF programs.</para>

      <para>Binary DXF is another matter, because if the DXF readers do not
      recognize a group code, they have no easy way to skip it.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>General File Structure.</title>

      <para>Essentially a DXF file is composed of pairs of codes and
      associated values.</para>

      <para>The codes, known as group codes, indicate the type of value that
      follows.</para>

      <para>Using these group code and value pairs, a DXF file is organized
      into sections, which are composed of records, which in turn are composed
      of a group code and a data item.</para>

      <para>Each group code and value are on their own line in the DXF
      file.</para>

      <para>Each section starts with a group code 0 followed by the string,
      SECTION.</para>

      <para>This is followed by a group code 2 and a string indicating the
      name of the section (for example, HEADER).</para>

      <para>Each section is composed of group codes and values that define its
      elements.</para>

      <para>A section ends with a 0 followed by the string ENDSEC.</para>

      <para>It may be helpful to produce a DXF file from a small drawing,
      print it out, and refer to it while reading the information presented
      next.</para>

      <section>
        <title>DXF File Structure.</title>

        <para>The overall organization of a DXF file is as follows:</para>

        <para>The ENTITIES section contains only the objects you select for
        output.</para>

        <para>If you select an insert entity, the corresponding block
        definition is not included in the output file.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Group Codes.</title>

        <para>Group codes and the associated values define a specific aspect
        of an object or entity.</para>

        <para>The line immediately following the group code is the associated
        value.</para>

        <para>This value can be a a string, an integer, or a floating-point
        value, such as the X coordinate of a point.</para>

        <para>The lines following the second line of the group, if any, are
        determined by the group definition and the data associated with the
        group.</para>

        <para>Special group codes are used as file separators, such as markers
        for the beginning and end of sections, tables, and the end of the file
        itself.</para>

        <para>Entities, objects, classes, tables and table entries, and file
        separators are introduced with a 0 group code that is followed by a
        name describing the group.</para>

        <para>The maximum DXF file string length is 256 characters.</para>

        <para>If your AutoCAD drawing contains strings that exceed this
        number, those strings are truncated during DXFOUT.</para>

        <para>DXFIN fails if your DXF file contains strings that exceed this
        number.</para>

        <section>
          <title>ASCII Control Characters.</title>

          <para>DXFOUT handles ASCII control characters in text strings by
          expanding the character into a caret (^) followed by the appropriate
          letter.</para>

          <para>For example, an ASCII Control-G (BEL, decimal code 7) is
          output as ^G.</para>

          <para>If the text itself contains a caret character, it is expanded
          to caret, space (^ ).</para>

          <para>DXFIN performs the complementary conversion.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Group Code Ranges.</title>

          <para>Group codes define the type of the associated value as an
          integer, a floating-point number, or a string, according to the
          following table of group code ranges.</para>

                    line following it is a comment string. DXFOUT does not
                    include such groups in a DXF output file, but DXFIN honors
                    them and ignores the comments. You can use the 999 group
                    to include comments in a DXF file you've edited.</entry>

          <para>In DXF, the definition of objects differs from entities:
          objects have no graphical representation and entities do.</para>

          <para>For example, dictionaries are objects, not entities.</para>

          <para>Entities are also referred to as graphical objects while
          objects are referred to as nongraphical objects.</para>

          <para>An entity and items appear in both the BLOCK and ENTITIES
          sections of the DXF file.</para>

          <para>The appearance of entities in the two sections is
          identical.</para>

          <para>Some group codes that define an entity always appear; others
          are optional and appear only if their values differ from the
          defaults.</para>

          <para>Programs that read DXF files should not assume that the groups
          describing an entity occur in the order given here.</para>

          <para>The end of an entity is indicated by the next 0 group, which
          begins the next entity or indicates the end of the section.</para>

          <para><note>
              <para>As AutoCAD is further enhanced, new group codes will be
              added to entities to accommodate additional features.</para>

              <para>Accommodating DXF files from future releases of AutoCAD
              will be easier if you write your DXF processing program in a
              table-driven way, ignore undefined group codes, and make no
              assumptions about the order of group codes in an entity.</para>
            </note>For all objects and entities, AutoCAD uses the group codes
          described in the following table.</para>

          <para>Note that the handle (5) group code must be output immediately
          after the 0 group code for nongraphical objects.<table>

        <title>TABLES Section.</title>

        <para>The TABLES section contains several tables, each of which can
        contain a variable number of entries.</para>

        <para>The order of the tables may change, but the LTYPE table always
        precedes the LAYER table.</para>

        <para>Each table is introduced with a 0 group with the label
        TABLE.</para>

        <para>This is followed by a 2 group identifying the particular table
        (APPID, DIMSTYLE, LAYER, LTYPE, STYLE, UCS, VIEW, VPORT, or
        BLOCK_RECORD ), a 5 group (a handle), a group 100 (AcDbSymbolTable
        subclass marker), and a 70 group that specifies the maximum number of
        table entries that may follow.</para>

        <para>Table names are output in uppercase characters.</para>

        <para>The DIMSTYLE handle is a 105 group, not a 5 group.</para>

        <para>The tables in a drawing can contain deleted items, but these are
        not written to the DXF file.</para>

        <para>Thus, fewer table entries may follow the table header than are
        indicated by the 70 group, so do not use the count in the 70 group as
        an index to read in the table.</para>

        <para>This group is provided so that a program that reads DXF files
        can allocate an array large enough to hold all the table entries that
        follow.</para>

        <para>Following this header for each table are the table
        entries.</para>

        <para>Each table item consists of a 0 group identifying the item type
        (same as table name, such as LTYPE or LAYER), a 2 group giving the
        name of the table entry, a 70 group specifying flags relevant to the
        table entry (defined for each following table), and additional groups
        that give the value of the table entry.</para>

        <para>The end of each table is indicated by a 0 group with the value
        ENDTAB.</para>

        <para>Both symbol table records and symbol tables are database
        objects.</para>

        <para>At a very minimum, with all prevailing usage within AutoCAD,
        this implies that a handle is present, positioned after the 2 group
        codes for both the symbol table record objects and the symbol table
        objects.</para>

        <para>The DIMSTYLE table is the only record type in the system with a
        handle code of 105 because of its earlier usage of group code
        5.</para>

        <para>As a rule, programmers should not be concerned about this
        exception unless it is in the context of the DIMSTYLE table
        section.</para>

        <para>This is the only context in which this exception should
        occur.</para>

        <para>Common 70 group flag bit-coded values are described in the
        following table.</para>

        <para>Additional 70 group values that apply to LAYER, STYLE, and VIEW

        <title>BLOCKS Section.</title>

        <para>The BLOCKS section of the DXF file contains all the block
        definitions.</para>

        <para>It contains the entities that make up the blocks used in the
        drawing, including anonymous blocks generated by the HATCH command and
        by associative dimensioning.</para>

        <para>The format of the entities in this section is identical to those
        in the ENTITIES section.</para>

        <para>All entities in the BLOCKS section appear between block and
        endblk entities.</para>

        <para>Block and endblk entities appear only in the BLOCKS
        section.</para>

        <para>Block definitions are never nested (that is, no block or endblk
        entity ever appears within another block-endblk pair), although a
        block definition can contain an insert entity.</para>

        <para>External references are written in the DXF file as any block
        definition, except that they also include a text string (group code 1)
        of the path and file name of the external reference.</para>

        <para>The block table handle along with any xdata and persistent
        reactors will appear in each block definition immediately following
        the BLOCK record, which contains all of the specific information that
        a block table record stores.</para>

        <para>Therefore, each block definition has the following sequence of
        records:</para>

        <para>Although any entity or object definition can have extended data

        AutoCAD regularly attaches xdata to are noted following the table of

          <para>The following table shows group codes that apply to virtually

          <para>Some of the group codes are included with an entity only if
          the entity has nondefault values for these properties.</para>

        <title>OBJECTS Section.</title>

        <para>Objects are similar to entities, except that they have no
        graphical or geometric meaning.</para>

        <para>All objects that are not entities or symbol table records or
        symbol tables are stored in this section.</para>

        <para>This section represents a homogeneous heap of objects with
        topological ordering of objects by ownership, such that the owners
        always appear before the objects they own.</para>

        <para>The root owner of all objects appearing in this section is the
        named object dictionary, which is therefore always the first object
        that appears in this section.</para>

        <para>Objects in this section may be defined by either AutoCAD or by
        applications with access to ARX application libraries.</para>

        <para>The DXF names of application-defined object types should always
        be associated with a class name in the CLASS section of the DXF file,
        or else the object record cannot be bound to the application that will
        interpret it.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Named Object Dictionary.</title>

          <para>The named-object dictionary is the root owner of all
          nongraphical objects in the drawing with the exception of objects
          and classes associated with the pre-Release 13 DXF structure.</para>

          <para>As with other dictionaries, the named-object dictionary record
          consists solely of associated pairs of entry names and hard
          ownership pointer references to the associated object.</para>

          <para>AutoCAD adds objects to the dictionary with a name (key) that
          is always prefixed with ACAD_.</para>

          <para>Other Autodesk applications reserve the right to any prefix
          that begins with AC.</para>

          <para>Other software vendors are required to use their registered
          developer prefix for their entries, in order to avoid name
          collision.</para>

          <para>Objects of any type may be given a prefix.</para>

          <para>The following table shows group codes that apply to virtually

          <para>When you refer to the table of group codes by entity type,
          which lists the codes associated with specific entities, keep in
          mind that the codes shown here can also be present.</para>

          <para>Some of the group codes are included with an entity only if
          the entity has non-default values for these properties.</para>

          <para>When a group is omitted, its default value upon input (when
          using DXFIN) is indicated in the third column.</para>

          <para>If the value of a group code is equal to the default, it is
          omitted upon output (when using DXFOUT).<table>

        <title>Database Objects.</title>

        <para>AutoCAD drawings consist largely of structured containers for

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>A handle whose value is unique to the .dwg/.dxf file, and is
            constant for the lifetime of the drawing.</para>

            <para>This format has existed since AutoCAD Release 10, but as of
            AutoCAD Release 13, handles are always enabled.</para>
          </listitem>

            <para>An optional xdata table, as entities have had since AutoCAD
            Release 11.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>An optional persistent reactor table.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>An optional ownership pointer to an extension dictionary,
            which in turn will own subobjects placed in it by an
            application.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Symbol tables and symbol table records are database objects and,
        thus, have a handle.</para>

        <para>They can also have xdata and persistent reactors in their DXF
        records.</para>

        <title>Persistent Inter-Object Reference Handles.</title>

        <para>A set of group code ranges permit objects to directly specify
        references to other objects within the same drawing/DXF file.</para>

        <para>There are four ranges to go with the four types of relationships
        that can be specified:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Soft pointer handle.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Hard pointer handle.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Soft owner handle.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Hard owner handle.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>These handle types are manifested as entity names in AutoLISP,
        as ads_name values in ADS and as like-named classes derived from
        ARX.</para>

        <para>These values are always maintained in insert, xref, and wblock
        operations, such that references between objects in a set being copied
        are updated to point to the copied objects, while references to other
        objects remain unchanged.</para>

        <para>Also, a group code range for "arbitrary" handles is defined to
        allow convenient storage of handle values that are not converted to
        entity names and then translated in insert, xref, or wblock.<note>
            <para>If you use 1005 xdata group codes to store handles, they are
            treated as soft pointer handles, which means that when groups of
            objects are copied or are inserted into another drawing,
            references between the involved objects are translated.</para>

            <para>Although 1005 xdata items are always returned as handles in
            AutoLISP and ADS, all of the reference handle group code ranges

          <title>Pointer and Ownership References.</title>

          <para>A pointer is a reference that indicates usage but not
          possession or responsibility for another object.</para>

          <para>Pointer references mean that the object uses the other object
          in some way, and shares access to it.</para>

          <para>An ownership reference means that an owner object is
          responsible for the objects for which it has an owner handle.</para>

          <para>Ownership references direct the writing of the entire dwg and
          dxf files in a generic manner, such as beginning from a few key root
          objects, the writing of an owner handle.</para>

          <para>An object can have any number of pointer references associated
          with it but can have only one owner.</para>

          <title>Hard and Soft.</title>

          <para>Hard references, whether they are pointer or owner, protect an
          object from being purged.</para>

          <para>Soft references do not.</para>

          <para>In AutoCAD, block definitions and complex entities are hard
          owners of their elements.</para>

          <para>A symbol table and dictionaries are soft owners of their
          elements.</para>

          <para>Polyline entities are hard owners of their vertex and seqend
          entities. Insert entities are hard owners of their attrib and seqend
          entities.</para>

          <para>When establishing a reference to another object, it is
          recommended that you think about whether the reference should
          protect an object from the PURGE command.</para>

          <title>Arbitrary Handles.</title>

          <para>Arbitrary handles are distinct in that they are not translated
          to session persistent identifiers internally, to entity names in
          AutoLISP, and so on.</para>

          <para>They are stored as handles.</para>

          <para>When translation of handle values are translated in
          drawing-merge operations, arbitrary handles are ignored.</para>

          <para>In all environments, arbitrary handles can be exchanged for
          entity names of the current drawing by means of the handent
          functions.</para>

          <para>A common usage of arbitrary handles is to refer to objects in
          external dxf and dwg files.</para>

          <title>1005 Group Codes.</title>

          <para>1005 xdata group codes have the same behavior and semantics as
          soft pointers, which means that they are translated whenever the
          host object is merged into a different drawing.</para>

          <para>However, 1005 items are not translated to session-persistent
          identifiers, internally entity names in AutoLISP and ADS.</para>

          <para>They are stored as handles.</para>

        <title>Subclass Markers.</title>

        <para>A big problem with filing a stream of group data is that a
        single object may be composed of several filer members, one for each
        level of inheritance where filing is done, which can be done by
        different developers.</para>

        <para>Because each level of inheritance can evolve separately, it is
        necessary to segregate the data of each class filer member from each
        other.</para>

        <para>All class filer members are expected to preceded their
        class-specific portion of instance data with a "subclass" marker--a
        100 group code followed by a string with the actual name of the
        class.</para>

        <para>This does not affect the state needed to define the object's
        state, but it provides a means for the DXF file parsers to direct the
        group codes to the corresponding application software.</para>

        <para>For example, an object which has data from different derived
        classes would be represented as follows:</para>

        <title>Arbitrary Axis Algorithm.</title>

        <para>The arbitrary axis algorithm is used by AutoCAD internally to
        implement the arbitrary but consistent generation of object coordinate
        systems for all entities which use object coordinates.</para>

        <para>Given a unit-length vector to be used as the Z axis of a
        coordinate system, the arbitrary axis algorithm generates a
        corresponding X axis for the coordinate system.</para>

        <para>The Y axis follows by application of the right-hand rule.</para>

        <para>The method is to examine the given Z axis (also called the
        normal vector) and see if it is close to the positive or negative
        World Z axis.</para>

        <para>If it is, cross the World Y axis with the given Z axis to arrive
        at the arbitrary X axis.</para>

        <para>If not, cross the World Z axis with the given Z axis to arrive
        at the arbitrary X axis.</para>

        <para>The boundary at which the decision is made was chosen to be both
        inexpensive to calculate and completely portable across
        machines.</para>

        <para>This is achieved by having a sort of "square" polar cap, the
        bounds of which is 1/64, which is precisely specifiable in six
        decimal-fraction digits and in six binary-fraction bits.</para>

        <para>The algorithm does the following.</para>

        <para>(All vectors are assumed to be in 3D space and specified in the
        World Coordinate System).</para>

        <programlisting>Let the given normal vector be called N.

Let the world Y axis be called Wy, which is always (0,1,0).

Let the world Z axis be called Wz, which is always (0,0,1).</programlisting>

        <para>Here we are looking for the arbitrary X and Y axes to go with
        the normal N.</para>

        <para>They will be called Ax and Ay.</para>

        <para>N could also be called Az (the arbitrary Z axis) as
        follows:</para>

        <programlisting>If (abs (Nx) &lt; 1/64) and (abs (Ny) &lt; 1/64) then
    Ax = Wy X N (where "X" is the cross-product operator).

Otherwise,
    Ax = Wz X N.

Scale Ax to unit length.</programlisting>

        <para>The method of getting the Ay vector is:</para>

        <programlisting>Ay = N X Ax. Scale Ay to unit length.</programlisting>

    <title>Binary DXF File Format.</title>

    <para>The ASCII DXF file format is a complete representation of an AutoCAD
    drawing in an ASCII text form, and is easily processed by other
    programs.</para>

    <para>In addition, AutoCAD can produce or read a binary form of the full
    DXF file and accept limited input in another binary file format.</para>

    <para>The DXFOUT command provides a Binary option that writes binary dxf
    files.</para>

    <para>Such a file contains all of the information present in an ASCII DXF
    file but in a more compact form that takes, typically, 25 percent less
    file space and can be read and written more quickly (typically, five times
    faster) by AutoCAD.</para>

    <para>Unlike ASCII dxf files, which entail a trade-off between size and
    floating-point accuracy, binary dxf files preserve all of the accuracy in
    the drawing database.</para>

    <para>(AutoCAD Release 10 was the first version to support this form of
    DXF file; it cannot be read by older versions.)</para>

    <para>A binary DXF file begins with a 22-byte sentinel consisting of the
    following:</para>

    <programlisting>AutoCAD Binary DXF&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;NULL&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>Following the sentinel are pairs (group, value) as in an ASCII DXF
    file but represented in binary form.</para>

    <para>The group code is a single-byte binary value, and the value that
    follows is one of the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A 2-byte integer with the least significant byte first and the
        most significant byte last.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>An 8-byte IEEE double-precision floating-point number stored
        with the least significant byte first and the most significant byte
        last.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>An ASCII string terminated by a 0 (NULL) byte.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The type of the datum following a group is determined from the group
    code by the same rules used in decoding ASCII DXF files.</para>

    <para>Translation of angles to degrees and dates to fractional Julian date
    representation is performed for binary files, as well as for ASCII DXF
    files.</para>

    <para>The comment group, 999, is not used in binary DXF files.</para>

    <para>Extended data group codes are represented in binary DXF as a single
    byte with the value 255, followed by a 2-byte integer value containing the
    actual group code, followed by the actual value.</para>

    <para>Extended data long (group code 1071) values occupy 4 bytes of
    data.</para>

    <para>Extended data binary chunks (group code 1004) are represented as a
    single-byte, unsigned integer length, followed by the specified number of
    bytes of chunk data.</para>

    <para>For example, to transfer an extended data long group, the following
    values would appear, occupying 1, 2, and 4 bytes respectively.</para>

    <programlisting>255            Escape group code

1071           True group code

999999         Value for the 1071 group code</programlisting>

    <para>DXFOUT writes binary DXF files with the same file type (.dxf) as for
    ASCII DXF files.</para>

    <para>The DXFIN command automatically recognizes a binary file by means of
    its sentinel string.</para>

    <para>There is no need for you to identify it as a binary file.</para>

    <para>If DXFIN encounters an error in a binary DXF file, it reports the
    byte address within the file where the error was detected.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>DXB Files.</title>

    <para>The DXF file formats are complete representations of an AutoCAD
    drawing that can be written and read by AutoCAD and other programs.</para>

    <para>However, programs executed by means of the external commands
    facility often need to supply simple geometric input to AutoCAD.</para>

    <para>For these purposes, AutoCAD supports another file format, called DXB
    (drawing interchange binary), which is limited in the entities it can
    represent.</para>

    <para>To load a DXB file, enter the DXBIN command:</para>

    <programlisting>dxbin</programlisting>

    <para>When AutoCAD prompts you, respond with the name of the file you want
    to load.</para>

    <para>You do not need to include a .dxb file because the type is
    assumed.</para>

    <para>There is no direct AutoCAD command for writing a DXB file, but the
    ADI "AutoCAD file output formats" plotter driver can write such a
    file.</para>

    <para>If you want to create a DXB file from an AutoCAD drawing, configure
    the "file output formats" plotter and select its "AutoCAD DXB file" output
    option.</para>

      <para>This information is for experienced programmers and is subject to

      </table>

      <para>The line extension item extends the last line or line extension
      from its To point to a new To point.</para>

      <para>The trace extension item extends the last trace solid, or trace
      extension from its x3,y3-x4,y4 ending line to a new x3,y3--x4,y4
      line.</para>

      <para>The scale factor is a floating-point value by which all integer
      coordinates are multiplied to obtain the floating-point coordinates used
      by the entities.</para>

      <para>The initial scale factor when a file is read is 1.0.</para>

      <para>The new layer item creates a layer if none exists, giving the new
      layer the same defaults as the LAYER New command, and sets that layer as
      the current layer for subsequent entities.</para>

      <para>At the end of the DXB file load, the layer in effect before the
      command is restored.</para>

      <para>The block base item specifies the base (origin) point of a created
      block.</para>

      <para>The block base must be defined before the first entity record is
      encountered.</para>

      <para>If DXB does not define a block, this specification is
      ignored.</para>

      <para>A polyline consists of straight segments of fixed width connecting
      the vertices, except as overridden by the bulge and width items.</para>

      <para>The closure flag should be 0 or 1; if it is 1, there is an
      implicit segment from the last vertex (immediately before the Seqend) to
      the first vertex.</para>

      <para>A bulge item, encountered between two vertex items (or after the
      last vertex of a closed polyline), indicates that the two vertices are
      connected by an arc rather by than a straight segment.</para>

      <para>If the distance between the vertices has length d, and the
      perpendicular distance from the midpoint of that segment to the arc is
      h, then the magnitude of the bulge is (2 * h / d).</para>

      <para>The sign is negative if the arc from the first vertex to the
      second is clockwise.</para>

      <para>A semicircle thus has a bulge of 1 (or -1).</para>

      <para>If the number mode is 0 (integer), bulge items are scaled by 2
      16.</para>

      <para>If the number mode has been set to floating point, then the
      floating-point value supplied is 2*h/d (not scaled).</para>

      <para>The width item indicates the starting and ending widths of the
      segment (straight or curved) connecting two vertices.</para>

      <para>This width stays in effect until the next width item or the
      seqend.</para>

      <para>If there is a width item between the polyline item and the first
      vertex, it is stored as a default width for the polyline.</para>

      <para>This saves considerable database space if the polyline has several
      segments of this width.</para>

      <para>The number mode item controls the mode of items with types given
      in the preceding table as n-, a-, or u-.</para>

      <para>If the value supplied is 0, these values will be integers;
      otherwise, they are floating point.</para>

      <para>To remember the last to-point, lines share the same cells, so do
      not mix extension groups for the two entities without an initial group
      before the extension.</para>

      <para>There is no extension group for 3D faces, because there is no
      obvious edge to extend from.</para>

      <para>The new color group specifies the color for subsequent entities in
      the DXB file.</para>

      <para>The w-colornum word argument is in the range from 0 to 256.</para>

      <para>0 means color by block, 1-255 are the standard AutoCAD colors, and
      256 means color by layer.</para>

      <para>A color outside the range from 0 to 256 sets the color back to the
      current entity color (you can do this deliberately, and it can be quite
      useful).</para>

      <para>The initial entity color of material added by DXBIN is the current
      entity color.</para>

      <para>All points specified in the DXB file are interpreted in terms of
      the current UCS at the time that the DXBIN command is executed.</para>

      <para>The Outline button displays an additional window which provides
      the contents of the Help file in an outline form.</para>

      <para>This outline makes it easier to view various parts of the document
      and navigate directly to the section you are interested in.</para>

      <para>The Find button displays the Find dialog which provides full text
      search over the entire document.</para>

      <para>The Find dialog functions in a similar manner as the Search
      dialog.</para>

      <para>The hdkctnts.dll file must be installed in the windows directory
      for the Outline and Find buttons to be functional.</para>

      <para>Additionally, the hdkctnts.hlp file provides help specific to the
      Outline window.</para>

      <para>It should also be installed in the windows directory.</para>

      <para>If the hdkctnts.dll file is not properly installed in the windows
      directory, choosing the Outline or Find buttons result in the Windows
      error message of "Routine not found". </para>
