<h1>Introduction.</h1>
<p>
Raster image files such as JPEG, TIFF and other supported formats, cannot be stored inside an AutoCAD drawing.<br>
The current mechanism for associating raster image files with drawings works similarly to the way external references (xrefs) are associated to drawings.<br>
The raster image can only be referenced in the drawing.<br>
The actual data containing information on how to represent the raster image remains in the raster image file itself.<br>
Therefore, the raster image file must accompany the drawing file when transported, or the raster data will not be represented when the drawing is opened.<br>
